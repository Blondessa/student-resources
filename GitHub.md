# GitHub

This is the main place for all program course notes. To access your specific course notes, please view these instructions:
- You’ll receive an email invite from GitHub that will prompt you to sign up. Please note: the invites sometimes appear as junk mail, please check your spam folder for the emails.
- Click “Join @ HackerYou” and either sign-in with your existing account or create a new account. 
- Once you accept the invitation and are logged in, you will see the course notes on the homepage: https://github.com/HackerYou. The direct link to the course notes will also be pinned in your course slack channel. 
- If you are a returning Juno student, and have provided your GitHub username in the pre-course form, you will be added by your username and will not receive a new email invitation. When you login to your GitHub account, you will see the new repo.

Each course has a specific course link to the notes on GitHub. You will find your specific course notes below and will have access to them before your course begins (see your Welcome Email for more details).
