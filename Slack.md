# Slack

## What is Slack used for?
All our classes use Slack for the main communication in the classroom. While we teach classes on Zoom, we use Slack channels to discuss topics, ask questions, and be engaged in the classroom. 

## How to Download Slack on your computer
Download Slack Desktop App ([Mac](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/mac?geocode=en-ca), [Windows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/windows)). Once you follow the instructions in those links, please make an account and complete your Slack profile.

## Can I use the web app or do I have to use the desktop version?
The desktop version of Slack provides access to more features, so please ensure you have downloaded the desktop version before your course begins. 

## Accepting a Slack invite
Once you've joined a class, you will be sent a Slack invite to the email you provided closer to the start of class. Please refer to the Welcome Email you receive for the approximate date you'll be added for your class. Once received, click the email invite and you'll be added to the class channel. See below on how to access your class channel on Slack. 
NOTE: If you have already been a part of a course at Juno previously, you will be added to Slack via your previous account. 

## How to create a Slack profile 
Use this guide to [Edit your Profile](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) or follow along with these simple step by step instructions:

- Click your profile picture in the top right corner and select “Edit Profile”.
- Please add your first and last name to the “Full Name” field - ensure this matches your full name
- Your “Display Name” will be the name used for your slack handle - please don’t be too creative here. I suggest using your first and last name.
- Click on “Upload an Image” to add your lovely face to Slack.
- Please ensure your time zone is correct.
- Add your pronouns to the “Pronouns” field.
- In “Bio” add a short About You statement. 
- Click “Save Changes” and marvel at your complete profile!

## How to access class channels on Slack
Before your class begins, you will be added to your class channel. 
1. On the leftside bar (add screenshot), you should see your course there.
2. Most of the time, it will have this naming convention: 
- year-season#-course (for part-time and acclerated courses)
- cohort#-bootcamp (for bootcamp)

If you don't see the the course on the leftside bar, here's how you can search for it:
- ADD instructions  

## Slack Huddles
Slack now has a feature where you can enter a huddle with people 1:1! A Huddle is voice-only conversation right in Slack. You can use this feature doing the following:
1. Click on the person in Slack you'd like to enter a Huddle with. You have to be in the messaging area, where you would send a DM to the person, in order to see the Huddle feature
2. On the bottom left corner, you'll see an antenna and the person's name and a little headphone's icon. Switch that on
3. You've entered the Huddle! The person will be notified that you have started a Huddle with them and will join
4. Voila! You can now talk to the person

Huddles are a great way to communicate with individuals quickly via voice chat. It works very similarly to call, but quicker and with no video. Try one today!

## The Slack Basics
### Slack Etiquette
Please make sure you are being respectful of everyone in your Slack channels. At Juno, we value inclusion and respect, and so we want to make sure everyone is practicing these values as they communicate in channels. This includes using inclusive language and making sure you are using the correct pronouns for people. 
- don't use @here or @channel in public channels
- "messaging to add in on the 'guys' slackbot"

### How to View Pinned Messages
1. Hover over the message you'd like to pin in the channel until the bar of commands shows
2. Click the "...(More Actions)" 
3. You should see an option entitled "Pin to Channel". Click on that and the message will show as a pinned message in the channel
 
### Bookmarks
In certain classes, you may see a Bookmarks Bar at the top. This includes important links to use throughout the duration of class. 

### How to have calls on Slack
Here is an overview on how to [Make Calls in Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack). Please note, you'll only be able to video call 1:1 and screen sharing is unavailable. 

### Slack Community Channels
Once you are added to the Juno College Community Slack, you will automatically be added to the following channels:
- helpme: this is where you can ask any general questions about the code you're working with
- random: a.k.a. our party room! Casual chit-chats and general fun go here!
- announcements: where important announcements related to the entire Juno Community go
