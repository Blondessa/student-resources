# Slack

## What is Slack used for?
All our classes use Slack for the main communication in the classroom. While we teach classes on Zoom, we use Slack channels to discuss topics, ask questions, and be engaged in the classroom. 

## How to Download Slack on your computer
Download Slack Desktop App ([Mac](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/mac?geocode=en-ca), [Windows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/windows)). Once you follow the instructions in those links, please make an account and complete your Slack profile.

## Can I use the web app or do I have to use the desktop version?
The desktop version of Slack provides access to more features, so please ensure you have downloaded the desktop version before your course begins. 

## Accepting a Slack invite
Add something about if you're a returning student you will be added to the slack channel with your existing account.

## How to create a Slack profile

## How to access class channels on Slack
Before your class begins, you will be added to your class channel. On the leftside bar (add screenshot), you should see your course there. Most of the time, it will have this naming convention: 
- year-season#-course (for part-time and acclerated courses)
- cohort#-bootcamp (for bootcamp)

If you don't see the the couse on the leftside bar, here's how you can search for it.

## The Slack Basics
### Slack Etiquette
Please make sure you are being respectful of everyone in your Slack channels. At Juno, we value inclusion and respect, and so we want to make sure everyone is practicing these values as they communicate in channels. This includes using inclusive language and making sure you are using the correct pronouns for people. 

- don't use @here or @channel in public channels
- Joanna will get messaging to add in on the 'guys' slackbot

### How to Pin Messages
FROM JOANNA - I don't actually want them pinning messages really, because it pins it for everyone. But we can turn this into how to view pinned messages! 

1. Hover over the message you'd like to pin in the channel until the bar of commands shows
2. Click the "...(More Actions)" 
3. You should see an option entitled "Pin to Channel". Click on that and the message will show as a pinned message in the channel
 
### Bookmarks
In certain classes, you may see a Bookmarks Bar at the top. This includes important links to use throughout the duration of class.
