# Slack

## What is Slack used for?
All our classes use Slack for the main communication in the classroom. While we teach classes on Zoom, we use Slack channels to discuss topics, ask questions, and be engaged in the classroom. 

## How to Download Slack on your computer
Download Slack Desktop App ([Mac](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/mac?geocode=en-ca), [Windows](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/windows)). Once you follow the instructions in those links, please make an account and complete your Slack profile.

## Can I use the web app or do I have to use the desktop/mobile version?
The desktop or mobile versions of Slack are so much easier to use throughout your courses here at Juno! Please download the desktop or app to use during your time at Juno. 

## How to access class channels on Slack
Once you accept your invite to the Juno Community Slack, you will also be automatically added to your class channel. On the leftside bar, you should see your course there. Most of the time, it will have this outline: 
- 2021-season#-course (for Con-Ed)
- cohort#-bootcamp (for Bootcamps)

## The Slack Basics
### Slack Etiquette
Please make sure you are being respectful of everyone in your Slack channels. At Juno, we value inclusion and respect, and so we want to make sure everyone is practicing these values as they communicate in channels. This includes using inclusive language and making sure you are using the correct pronouns for people. 

### How to Pin Messages
1. Hover over the message you'd like to pin in the channel until the bar of commands shows
2. Click the "...(More Actions)" 
3. You should see an option entitled "Pin to Channel". Click on that and the message will show as a pinned message in the channel
 
### Bookmarks
In certain classes, you may see a Bookmarks Bar at the top. This includes important links to use throughout the duration of class.
