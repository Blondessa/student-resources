# Zoom

## What is Zoom Used For?
Zoom is where we host all of our virtual classes. While we use Slack to communicate (see [Slack](/Slack.md) for more information), we use Zoom as the virtual classroom to teach our materials. Once signed up for a course, you will be given a Zoom link in your Welcome Email to access the Zoom classroom. This link will be active right at the start of a course until its end. The link will also be posted in the Slack Classroom Channel.
