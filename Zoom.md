# Zoom

## What is Zoom Used For?
Zoom is where we host all of our virtual classes. While we use Slack to communicate (see [Slack](/Slack.md) for more information), we use Zoom as the virtual classroom to teach our materials. Once signed up for a course, you will be given a Zoom link in your Welcome Email to access the Zoom classroom. This link will be active right at the start of a course until its end. The link will also be posted in the Slack Classroom Channel. 

## How to Download Zoom

## The Zoom Basics

### How to Add Pronouns
To see how to add your pronouns to your Zoom profile, please refer to [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4402698027533). 

### Break-out Rooms
From time to time, instructors will break you into Break-out Rooms to discuss project ideas or do in-class exercises with your classmates. The instructors will automatically asssign you to Break-out Rooms, all you need to do is click the accept button once the instructors assign Break-out Rooms, and you'll be placed in a randomly assigned room with your other classmates.  

### Zoom Etiquette at Juno 
During classes in the Zoom Classroom, we ask you to do the following:
1. Raise your hand if you have a question. In the "Reactions" area of Zoom, you can find the "Raise your hand" feature
2. Please do not use the Zoom chat for course-related questions or topics. We use Slack to communicate via messages in the classroom
3. If you can, please leave your video on for the duration of classes. This really helps our instructors and mentors know if students are understanding the material. So, if you can, please keep your video on
