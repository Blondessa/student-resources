# Information for Taxes

## Will I be getting a tax form for my classes?
- If you are completing the Bootcamp program, yes you will be receiving a tax form (T2202) for the year you complete the program. If you are in a Con-Ed course, unfortunately you will not receive a T4a, as only our Bootcamp programs are eiligible for this tax credit

## When will I get my tax form for Bootcamp?
- You will receive your T2202 for the tax year you completed the program in, regardless of when you paid for the course. For example, if you paid for the Bootcamp program in 2021, but do not start the program until 2022, you will get the T2202 for the 2022 tax year, which won't be issued until early 2023.
