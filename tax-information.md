# Information for Tax Forms

## Will I be getting a tax form for my classes?
- T2202As are only issued for our Full-Time Bootcamp Program as it's a vocational program that is recognized by the Ontario government. Unfortunately our part-time courses aren't eligible due to the timeline of the courses.

## When will I get my tax form for Bootcamp?
- You will receive your T2202 for the tax year you completed the program in, regardless of when you paid for the course. For example, if you paid for the Bootcamp program in 2021, but do not start the program until 2022, you will get the T2202 for the 2022 tax year, which won't be issued until early 2023.
