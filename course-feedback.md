# Submitting Course Feedback
Throughout your time at Juno College, you will be given opportunities to provide feedback for the program. For Con-Ed classes, you will be given time in class to complete a Mid-point and Final Feedback form. For Bootcamps, you will be given an opportunity to provide weekly feedback in class and also give your feedback at the end of the course on the Bootcamp Final Feedback form. For all these forms, you will be able to share your honest feedback anonymously. Have feedback you'd like to share at any time? Please message [Laura Easson](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com) via email or Slack!
