# Recordings of Classes
If you are going to miss class, please let one of your instructors or mentors know you will be away. A recording of class will be posted in a pinned thread in the Slack Classroom Channel the day after classes (with the exception of Friday, Saturday and/or Sunday classes; they will be posted on the following Monday). The recording will be available for streaming only. 

These recordings will be available 1 week from the date of class. 
- For example, if you have a class on Thursday September 9, you will receive the recording in the Slack Classroom Channel on Frida September 10 and it will be available until Thursday September 16, 1 week from the date of class. 
- PLEASE NOTE: we do not keep recordings stored and they will be deleted. 

If you need any additional support or accommodation, please message Laura Easson via [Slack](https://junocollege.slack.com/team/U01JN7E8ELE) or [email](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com) and we will review your request on a case by case basis.
