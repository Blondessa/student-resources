# Recordings of Classes
If you are going to miss class, please let one of your instructors or mentors know you will be away. A recording of class will be posted in a pinned thread in the Slack Classroom Channel the day after classes (with the exception of Friday, Saturday and/or Sunday classes; they will be posted on the following Monday). 

These recordings will be available 1 week from the date of class. For example, if you have a class on Saturday July 17, you will receive the recording in the Slack Classroom Channel on Monday July 19 and it will be available until Saturday July 24, 1 week from the date of class. 
PLEASE NOTE: we do not keep recordings stored and they will be deleted. 

If you need any additional support, please message [Laura Easson](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com) via email or Slack and we will review your request on a case by case basis.
