## What is self care?
From Mental Health First Aid Canada: “Self care is anything physical, emotional, social, or spiritual that contributes to managing everyday life (with all its joys and sorrows).”
When going through a particularly stressful situation, it is important to find ways to reduce immediate stress. It may help to talk with a friend, family member, cohort-mate, or a professional counsellor or mental health care provider. It is also important to plan care for yourself and pursue healthy coping strategies to use regularly as ways to reduce and prevent stress.

## Tips for Self Care
- Eat a well-balanced diet
- Avoid or limit your intake of alcohol, caffeine, drugs, and tobacco
- Drink plenty of water
- Exercise
- Get enough rest
- Know and respect your limits
- Be on the lookout for any changes in your habits, attitudes and moods.
</br>
Develop a plan for self care and take some time to do something just for yourself everyday. A self care
plan doesn’t need to be expensive or time-consuming! Some ideas include:
- Taking a break to read, watch a movie
- Savouring a bath or shower
- Finding ways to laugh
- Keeping your environment clean, bright, and cheerful
- Making time to chat with friends
- Journaling
- Reflecting, meditating, or praying
</br>

Thinking Distortions to avoid:
- All-or-nothing thinking
  - Using terms like “always”, “never”, or “forever” in situations that have no absolute/have grey areas
  - I.e. “I didn’t do well on project one, I’ll never catch up.”
- Overgeneralization
  - Seeing a negative event as a pattern of failure 
  - I.e. “I didn’t understand this exercise, I won’t understand any others”
- Mental filter/Selective thinking
  - Only remembering negative events, even when there may be a number of positive experiences related to those events 
- Disqualifying the positive
  - Taking a compliment, affirmation, or constructive feedback and turning it into a negative thought
- Jumping to negative conclusions
  - Assuming a negative outcome despite having no evidence to support this assumption
- Setting unrealistic expectations
  - Using “should” or “shouldn’t” as a way to describe behaviours
  - I.e. “I should only submit this project once it’s perfect” or “I shouldn’t take a break until I finish this exercise”
- Catastrophizing
  - Inflating the importance of events, mislabeling events to the extreme 
  - I.e. “I didn’t do well on this project, I’ll never get a job as a developer.”
- Personalization
  - Seeing yourself as the cause of negative events or assigning moral weight to them
  - I.e. “if i was a better student I would have understood this concept” or “I got the design I like the least, I have such bad luck.”
