## Alumni Office Hours

### What are Alumni Office Hours?
Alumni Office Hours are alumni-run help sessions for current students. If you need any project work help or need some additional help figuring out a coding concept, this is the session for you! A group of alumni mentors will be assigned to each Office Hour session, and, using HelpCue, you will be able to ask for assistance from one of our amazing alumni! Refer to your Welcome Email and class Slack Channel for your specific dates and times for these sessions.

### When are they?
Office Hours occur every other Thursday from 6:00pm - 8:00pm EDT and every other Saturday/Sunday from 1:00pm - 4:00pm EDT. You will get reminders in your Slack Course Channel for these Office Hours

### How do these sessions run?
You'll be using HelpCue and Slack! To ask questions, you'll join our Alumni Office Hours HelpCue Classroom. Here are some further instructions on how to participate:
- Log into [HelpCue](https://www.helpcue.com/) - our room code is Ptsu12hq
- Submit your question to HelpCue & Include your @SlackName
- One of our awesome alumni will reach out to you via Slack and help resolve your misbehaving code! Our alumni will be on HelpCue on the designated dates and times waiting for your questions to help you out individually.
