**Q:** I have an older computer than the requirements, will I need to use a totally different laptop/computer for the courses? </br>
**A:** What we suggest is, if the computer is a bit older than the requirements of our courses, try that computer out! If you're finding that the first couple classes are not the greatest for your computer, then you might have to find an alternative for your course.
