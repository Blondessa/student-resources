# FAQs

**Q:** I have an older computer than the requirements, will I need to use a totally different laptop/computer for the courses? </br>
**A:** What we suggest is, if the computer is a bit older than the requirements of our courses, try that computer out! If you're finding that the first couple classes are not the greatest for your computer, then you might have to find an alternative for your course.

**Q:** If I've taken a Juno course, do I get a discount on other Juno courses? </br>
**A:** Yes! Juno Alumni get a discount - There's an alumni discount of $250, so all alumni (con ed and bootcamp) will get this applied for future courses
That does not include family members.

**Q:** If I take a course at Juno College, will I be given a certificate or letter of completion? </br>
**A:** If you have taken one of our Part-Time or Accelerated courses, a letter of completion is given to students by request only. If you'd like to receive this, please contact Laura Easson via [Slack](https://junocollege.slack.com/team/U01JN7E8ELE) or [email](mailto:laura.easson@junocollege.com).
