# Setup Guide for Live Online Bootcamp

## Before Class Starts

Congratulations on your acceptance to Bootcamp! We’re looking forward to getting started!  

Please read through this guide carefully before your first day and complete all steps.

This guide covers:
1. Zoom 
2. VS Code Terminal and Live Share Extension
3. Slack
4. GitHub
5. Participating & Getting Help 


## Zoom

### Zoom Set Up
- Create a free account using the same email address you used to sign up for your Juno course
- Test your microphone and webcam with Zoom
- Zoom now allows you to add your pronouns. Refer to this guide to set this up 
- View the Zoom Overview to get familiar with Zoom on your machine

### Suggested Environment Setup for Lessons
- Use “Speaker View” in zoom for the best experience
- If you have access to an additional monitor, use it! There is also a zoom app, so your phone or tablet could become an additional screen
- If you do not have access to an additional monitor, we recommend you set up the Zoom window so it takes up the half of your screen and you can view the notes and your text editor on the other half of your screen

For example, here’s a set up with the zoom window on the top half of your screen:

And here’s an example with your zoom screen on the left side of your screen:

### VS Code Live Share
- Follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-live-share-with-visual-studio-code) to download the Live Share extension


## Slack
There is a guide in this repository all on Slack setup. These are some further instructors specifically for the Bootcamp.

### Slack Set Up
- Download the Slack [desktop app](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043) to enable features like Slack video calls that are not available using the web app.

### Complete Your Slack Profile
Help your cohort mates get to know you by having a complete profile! Use this guide to Edit your Profile or follow along with my simple step by step instructions:
1. Click your profile picture in the top right corner and select “Edit Profile”.
2. Please add your first and last name to the “Full Name” field. 
3. Your “Display Name” will be the name used for your slack handle - please don’t be too creative here. I suggest using your first and last name.
4. Click on “Upload an Image” to add your lovely face to Slack.
5. Please ensure your time zone is correct.
6. Add your pronouns to the “Pronouns” field.
7. Add your Cohort # to this if you’d like to! (your Cohort # should be in your Welcome Email)
8. In “Bio” add a short About You statement. 
9. Click “Save Changes” and marvel at your complete profile!

### Video Calling on Slack
Slack works better as a downloaded program versus on the web app. You will need to have the desktop app in order to use full functionality, including making Slack video calls.

To make a call:
1. Type /call or press the phone icon at the top right of a direct message conversation or channel. This will send a call request to everyone in the direct message conversation or channel.
2. When the call connects, you will have a few options at the bottom of the screen.
- Turn your camera by pressing the camera icon at the bottom. 
- Mute or unmute yourself using the microphone icon at the bottom. 
- The computer screen icon will let you share your screen and select which desktop you would like to share.  
- The smiley face icon lets you use emojis. You can add emojis by selecting the keyboard on the right hand side of the emojis
- Hang up by pressing the red phone icon, or closing the window.

## Participating and Getting Help

### Asking Questions During Project Work Time
- Ask your questions via HelpCue. Your class HelpCue code will be shared during class.
  - Ask clear, detailed questions about the problem you’re having
  - Include info about what you’ve already tried to solve the problem
  - Add your name and include your Slack @ to make sure your instructors message the right person!
- Here’s an example question: "Hi it’s ________. I am having trouble with _____. My slack username is ______. I've tried _______ and _____.”
- An instructor will DM you via Slack and troubleshoot your problem
- Please ensure you’re paying attention to Slack when you add questions to HelpCue. The instructor will wait for 5 minutes for a response before moving on to the next question in the queue.

### Asking Questions After Class Hours
