## Zoom

### Zoom Set Up
- Create a free account using the same email address you used to sign up for your Juno course
- Test your microphone and webcam with Zoom
- Zoom now allows you to add your pronouns. Refer to this guide to set this up 
- View the Zoom Overview to get familiar with Zoom on your machine

### Suggested Environment Setup for Lessons
- Use “Speaker View” in zoom for the best experience
- If you have access to an additional monitor, use it! There is also a zoom app, so your phone or tablet could become an additional screen
- If you do not have access to an additional monitor, we recommend you set up the Zoom window so it takes up the half of your screen and you can view the notes and your text editor on the other half of your screen

For example, here’s a set up with the zoom window on the top half of your screen:

And here’s an example with your zoom screen on the left side of your screen:
