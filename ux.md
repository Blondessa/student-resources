## Computer Requirements
- You need a Mac for this class and all software (Slack, etc.) needs to be downloaded for Mac
- Juno students will need a Mac for this class. We recommend you use:
  - An Apple laptop newer than 6 years old running one of the 3 most recent major releases of MacOS (currently: 10.14 (Mojave) or newer)
  - Machines outside these parameters may still work, but might have issues running the software and tooling needed to complete coursework.
